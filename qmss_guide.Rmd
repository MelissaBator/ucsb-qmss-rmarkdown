# Introduction

[R Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) is a powerful and flexible tool for reproducible data analysis, collaboration, and publication (e.g. papers, blogs, websites, dashboards, CVs) in R or other languages (Python, SQL, and more).

## Workshop outline

1.  Review basics of working in R Markdown for data analysis

2.  Learn to reference code outputs in text for reproducible and efficient reporting

3.  Customize R Markdown outputs for fun and functionality

4.  Explore useful features for research, including:

    -   [Sourcing external scripts](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown-cookbook/source-script.html) in an Rmd
    -   [Caching](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown-cookbook/cache.html) time consuming code chunks
    -   Adding a [bibliography](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/authoring_bibliographies_and_citations.html)
    -   From R Markdown to R scripts and back with `spin()` and `purl()`

# Demos

## R Markdown essentials

We will consider three essential elements of R Markdown in this workshop:

-   YAML
-   Markdown text
-   Code chunks

### YAML

The YAML ("YAML ain't markup language" or "Yet another markup language") is the document information stored atop the R Markdown document, bounded on each end by `---`. When you first create a new .Rmd, that will look something like this:

    ---
    title: "Document title"
    author: "Author"
    date: "MM/DD/YYYY"
    output: html_document
    ---

We'll leave it as-is for now, but know that this is where we can quickly set a number of options for the document related to output format, themes, layouts, and more.

### Markdown text

Most stuff that is *outside* of the YAML and code chunks in our .Rmd is our text in markdown. We won't spend a lot of time customizing text, but here are a few commonly used formatting examples:

#### Headers

Use different numbers of pound signs (hashtags) to start a new line, followed by a space then the text, to create headers. If there is one `#`, that is a level one (by default, the largest) header. As you increase the number of pound signs to start a line, the header decreases in size.

This written in R Markdown:

\#\#\# Header 3

...produces a Level 3 (moderately sized) header when knitted.

And we use markdown similarly to update text in other ways, like:

-   A single asterisk on either side of text makes it *italic*
-   A double asterisk on either side of text makes it *bold*
-   Use hats on the end of text to make a^superscript^
-   Or an tilde (\~) on each end to make a~subscript~

You could manually format all of your text in markdown. OR (drum roll) you could use the shiny new visual editor in RMarkdown (formal release of [RStudio 1.4 announced January 2020](https://blog.rstudio.com/2021/01/19/announcing-rstudio-1-4/)). If you are running the newest version of RStudio, there is a compass icon in the top right of the .Rmd tab that allows you to switch between the Visual Editor and plain markdown.

### Code chunks

Code chunks are where we'll add most code in an R Markdown document (though we'll see later we can also add or refer to R code inline). There are a number of ways to add a code chunk, including: 

- Click on the green `+ c` button in the top bar for the .Rmd, then choose `R` (or explore options for adding code in other languages)

- In the menu, click Code > Insert Chunk

- Use the shortcut (Cmd + Option + I) << my favorite

- Just type in the start and end gates (\`\`\``{r}` to start, \`\`\` to end)

Within a new code chunk, let's add some code: 

```{r, echo = TRUE}
ggplot(data = penguins, aes(x = species, y = body_mass_g)) +
  geom_jitter()
```

When we knit, the code and graph appear in the document, demonstrating that we can have our text, code and outputs all in the same place - and any outputs will automatically update when we change our code & re-knit.

### Aside: chunk hooks

[Chunk hooks](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown-cookbook/chunk-hooks.html) are functions applied to the code chunk. They can do a bunch of different things, but a common use is to control what shows up (or is hidden) in the knitted document. 

Chunk hooks can be added to individual code chunk headers (within the `{r}` atop the chunk), or applied globally by adding options to the `{r setup}` code chunk at the top of the document. 

Here are some common hooks: 

- `echo = FALSE`: do not show the code in the knitted document
- `include = FALSE`: do not include code or any outputs in knitted document
- `message = FALSE`: suppress messages when knit
- `warning = FALSE`: suppress warnings when knit
- `eval = FALSE`: do not evaluate this code

## Inline code

Often, we want to reference code outcomes *within* our text. For example, we may want to refer to a mean value, like: 

      "The mean nitrate concentration in Lake A is 11.2 mg/L." 

The common option of copying and pasting values, however, is **tedious** and **dangerous**. A better way is to refer to code outputs directly, so that values are updated automatically when code or data change. 

In R Markdown, we add code inline with a single back-tick (`) on either end, and a lowercase r between to start it.

Then we can insert code within our text, like this: "The mean flipper length for all penguins in the dataset is `r round(mean(penguins$flipper_length_mm, na.rm = TRUE), 2)` mm."

Then, if our data or code ever *change*, so will our text output.  

## R Markdown customization

For today, we'll make changes to the YAML in our .Rmd to fancy our output document. Our customization will be related to our knitted HTML output, using the following: 

- `toc: true`: add a table of contents based on header hierarchies
- `toc_float: true`: make it a floating TOC
- `number_sections: true`: add numbered sections based on header hierarchy
- `theme: _____`: add a bootstrap theme
- `code_folding: hide`: code is default hidden, but available if the reader clicks on the 'Code' button created

For free bootstrap themes, visit: https://bootswatch.com/3/

To add options to the YAML, add them as "children" in the `html_document` subsection. Beware of spacing here: generally add 2 spaces of indentation for each new sublevel in the YAML hierarchy.
